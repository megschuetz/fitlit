## Introduction
FitLit is a fitness dashboard displaying a single users health activity such as steps, flights, sleep and hydration. 
We used four API's to fetch the data and several classes to manipulate displaying the data via the DOM. We pulled inspiration from relaxation apps and went for a desert theme when styling.

## Reflections
With only a general spec sheet of what the site needed to do, one of the challenges of this project was the architecture. Beginning the class structure was diffuculty at first, but as we looked at the data and decided what we would display we gain direction. As a team we learned how impactful code reviews are in order to stay on track and understand eachothers code. Dealing with a larger data set for this project we also learned it will be benefical in the future to thoroughly look at the data first.
